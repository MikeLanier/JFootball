        [x] string class used to build and display the string.
            - Defined JString as a subclass of the TextFlow layout, which can be added to the JPanel which the
                PlayByPlay field is a subclass of.  To show a message, remove the existing JString/TextFlow object
                from the PlayByPlay/JPanel and add the new one.
            - When I first did this, the App locked up.  After fiddling with the code, it started working.  Don't know
                what I did for it to start working.  A little concerned that I have a flaw lurking out there.
